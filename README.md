# Java Array and ArrayList Utilities

## Overview
This project demonstrates key operations with **arrays** and **ArrayLists** in Java:
- **Separating Even and Odd Numbers** from user input
- **Finding Adjacent Numbers with the Smallest Difference**
- **Converting Between Arrays and ArrayLists**

## Features
1. **Even-Odd Number Separation**  
   - Takes user input and classifies numbers into even and odd lists.

2. **Adjacent Number Difference Finder**  
   - Identifies consecutive numbers with the smallest absolute difference.
   - Returns the index of the first number in the closest pair.

3. **Array and ArrayList Conversion**  
   - Converts arrays to `ArrayList` and vice versa.

4. **Menu-Driven Interface**  
   - Provides an interactive interface for selecting operations with input validation and error handling.

## Program Structure
- **`Main.java`**: Entry point, handles user interactions and calls relevant methods.
- **`EvenOddSeparator.java`**: Manages the separation of numbers into even and odd lists.
- **`SmallestDistanceFinder.java`**: Locates the index of adjacent numbers with the smallest difference.
- **`ArrayConverter.java`**: Handles conversions between arrays and `ArrayLists`.
