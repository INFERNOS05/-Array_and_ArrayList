Java Array and ArrayList Utilities

Overview

This project showcases operations involving arrays and ArrayLists in Java. It enables:

Even-Odd Number Separation from user input.

Identification of Adjacent Numbers with Minimal Difference.

Conversion between Arrays and ArrayLists.

Features

Even-Odd Number Separation

Accepts user input and classifies numbers into even and odd lists.

Adjacent Number Difference Finder

Detects consecutive numbers with the smallest absolute difference.

Returns the index of the first number in the pair.

Array and ArrayList Conversion

Converts arrays to ArrayList and vice versa.

Interactive Menu-Driven Interface

Facilitates user operation selection with input validation and exception handling.

Program Structure

Main.java: Entry point managing user interactions and method calls.

EvenOddSeparator.java: Separates numbers into even and odd categories.

SmallestDistanceFinder.java: Identifies indices of adjacent numbers with minimal difference.
